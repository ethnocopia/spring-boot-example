# Code Review: Customer Class

## Overview
The "Customer" class is well-structured as a JPA entity, with proper annotations for database persistence. It includes fields, constructors, getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.

## Recommendations
Consider using Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code.

# Code Review: CustomerRepository Interface

## Overview
The "CustomerRepository" extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository`. It's correctly structured, but for a more comprehensive approach, introduce a `CustomerService` for business operations.

## Recommendations
Create a `CustomerService` to handle business logic.

# Code Review: Main (Controller) Class

## Overview
The "Main" class is the application's entry point, following RESTful conventions. However, it's recommended to introduce a service layer to separate data access from the controller.

## Recommendations
- Inject `CustomerService` in the constructor for better separation of concerns.
- Implement proper error handling and response status codes.

# Response and Exception Handling
Consider creating dedicated error and exception handling classes for comprehensive application-wide exception management.
